# Youtube time calculator:
this application allows you to calculate the time you would lose or win  by speeding up or slowing down a video of a certain duration...
you can paste links to youtube videos to get their duration immediately and check how much time you would save if you watched them a little faster, or how much time you would lose if you watched them slower.
you can also write the duration you want and check yourself how much time could be saved or not.
